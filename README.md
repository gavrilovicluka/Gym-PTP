## Gym-PTP (Personal Training Plan) Recommender System

This is a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** application developed for the **Intelligent Systems** course as part of **Master Academic Studies** at the **Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni≈°**.  

The application recommends **personalized gym training programs** based on user profile, fitness goals, experience level, and available equipment. The system uses **AI models** ‚Äî both classical supervised learning and deep learning ‚Äî to automatically select the best model for predictions. The best model is selected automatically and served through a Flask backend, with a React frontend for user interaction.
