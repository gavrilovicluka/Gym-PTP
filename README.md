# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gym-PTP MVP

## Gym-PTP (Personal Training Plan) Recommender System

This is a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** application developed for the **Intelligent Systems** course as part of **Master Academic Studies** at the **Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni≈°**.  

The application recommends **personalized gym training programs** based on user profile, fitness goals, experience level, available equipment, desired workout program duration, and desired workout duration per workout. The system uses **classical ML models (k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN))** to find the most relevant programs for user. The best model is selected automatically and served through a FastAPI backend, with a React frontend for user interaction.

## üìÇ Dataset

The project uses the [600k Fitness Exercise and Workout Program dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnanelouardi/600k-fitness-exercise-and-workout-program-dataset). 
**Note:** 
- To simply run the prediction service, you do **not** need to download the raw data. 
- The necessary pre-processed data and model artifacts are already included `ml-service/trained_models/` (or generated by the notebook). 
- If you want to re-run `model_exploration.ipynb`, create a `data/` folder in the root directory and place the downloaded dataset files there.

---

## üìì Jupyter Notebook
This notebook is located in `notebooks/` folder. It is used for dataset exploration and cleaning, as well as creating KNN model for suggesting the most relevant training program with exercises. When this notebook is run, it will generate neccessary files for model and preprocessing used in `ml-service`.

## üöÄ Running the Application

The application can be run in two ways: using **Docker Compose** or **locally** (for development/testing).

### üê≥ 1. Run with Docker Compose

This method starts **all services** (ML service, API service, and Frontend) in isolated containers.

**Steps:**
1.  **Clone** the repository and navigate into the folder:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gavrilovicluka/Gym-PTP.git
    cd Gym-PTP
    ```
2.  **Build and start** the containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d 
    # Use '-d' to run in the background
    ```

**Service Status:**
* **ML Service (FastAPI):** Available at `http://localhost:8001/` (Documentation: `http://localhost:8001/docs`)
* **API Service (Frontend Gateway):** Available at `http://localhost:8000/` (Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`)

To stop the services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Run locally (without Docker)

This method is suitable for local development and testing individual services. **Both services must be run separately.**

**Prerequisites:**
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- **Install required packages** for each service:
``` bash
# For the ML Service
pip install -r ml-service/requirements.txt

# For the API Service
pip install -r api-service/requirements.txt
```

#### 2.1 ü§ñ Start ML Prediction Service (port 8001)

This service hosts the kNN model and serves the recommendations.
- Run it from the **root** directory: 
``` bash
uvicorn ml-service.main:app --reload --port 8001
```
- ML prediction service will be running at: http://127.0.0.1:8001/. You can test the API endpoints and view the documentation (Swagger UI) at http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs.


#### 2.2 üåê Start API Service (port 8000)

This service acts as the gateway between the Frontend and the ML service.

- Run it from the **root** directory: 
``` bash
uvicorn api-service.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

- API service will be running at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can test the API endpoints and view the documentation (Swagger UI) at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
